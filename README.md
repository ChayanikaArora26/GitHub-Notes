# GitHub-Notes
This repository presents a structured overview of fundamental Git and GitHub concepts, focusing on version control principles and industry-standard workflows for collaborative software development. It documents the lifecycle of code changes through Git’s working directory, staging area, and commit history, and explains how file states are managed within a distributed version control system. The repository includes essential command-line operations for repository initialization, configuration, change tracking, history inspection, and controlled rollback of modifications. It further addresses branching and merging strategies remembering to enable parallel development while maintaining code stability. In addition, the repository outlines core GitHub workflows, including remote repository integration, code synchronization, and collaborative development practices. Collectively, this work serves as a practical academic reference and a portfolio-ready demonstration of foundational proficiency in Git and GitHub for software engineering and data-driven development environments.
